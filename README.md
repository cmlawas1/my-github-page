What are your key takeaways from this exercise?
1. Layouting takes time. It's better to take time and conceptualize how you want your website to look like before executing it.
2. Flexboxes can be placed within another flexbox. There are plenty more flex attributes that are useful for creating the layout that you want.
3. Google/Stackoverflow is your friend. When you're having trouble with your code, don't be afraid to find solutions online. (Of course, search only after trying to solve it on your own!)
